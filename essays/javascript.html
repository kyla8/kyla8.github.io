<p><em>JavaScript is the most versatile programming language out there.</em></p>

<p>In a world where programming languages jostle for supremacy like gladiators in a digital arena, JavaScript has paved its way and struggled through it all. I’m not here to preach that JavaScript is the one and only programming language out there. But let’s be real – you got to give it some credit!</p>

<h3 id="personal-experience">Personal Experience</h3>

<p>As a complete newbie, my first experience in the realm of programming was with JavaScript was in my first programming class in High School. We learned how to make video games, websites, and had a final project where we built a website for an imaginary small business that had frontend and backend features. I won’t lie, I’m not going to miss the endless search for the elusive misplaced semicolons. Also, I liked how everything was open source, so if I had a question about something in JavaScript, no doubt I would be able to find the answer somewhere on StackOverflow.</p>

<p>After learning various other programming languages – C, C++, Java, Python, and R – JavaScript is still the easiest to understand and relearn. Unlike languages like Python, which is known for its clean and readable syntax, or C++ with its focus on performance, JavaScript strikes a balance between simplicity and versatility. Its dynamic nature and loosely typed characteristics can make it both thrilling and confusing for newcomers.</p>

<h3 id="experience-in-ics-314-software-engineering">Experience in ICS 314: Software Engineering</h3>

<p>Through ICS 314, I learned different aspects of of ES6, like arrow functions, classes, and destructuring. If you thought JavaScript was just a playful sprite, ES6 showed its power by adding more structure and elegance to its syntax.</p>

<p>On the low end, there are countless things you can do and programs you can make with JavaScript, such as making websites, making a task tracker, utilizing databases, etc. On the high end, there are countless other things you can do, such as Node.js for building servers, user authentication, real-time communication between clients and servers. Whether you’re just starting out in the world of JavaScript or you’re a seasoned developer looking for a challenge, these example projects offer opportunities to learn, practice, and showcase skills. The WODs (timed programming practices) are a bit stressful. For the first couple minutes, I freak out and sometimes overthink what the WOD is asking. With continued practice, I hope the WOD experiences will allow me to grow my programming skills and help me in technical job interviews (especially under pressure).</p>

<p>Now, what you’re really here for – why “World Domination”? Here, in this era JavaScript reigns supreme. As I look back on my own journey, from battling syntax errors to wielding the mighty arrow functions, I can’t help but feel a sense of admiration for this versatile language. It’s like a mischievous sidekick that challenges you, frustrates you, but ultimately makes you a better developer.</p>

<p>So, if you are ever worried about AI one day taking over the world, don’t be, because it’ll probably be JavaScript that takes over the world first.</p>
