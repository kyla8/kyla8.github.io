<h3 id="i-introduction">I. Introduction</h3>

<p>The use of artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized education by offering tools and methodologies that enhance learning experience, especially in Software Engineering. AI transformed the learning landscape by focusing on the dynamic nature of the field and prepares students for real-world challenges by providing them with exposure to the latest advancements in technology. Throughout the course, various AI tools, methodologies, and concepts were employed, such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Co-Pilot, shaping my learning journey in the realm of software engineering.</p>

<h3 id="ii-personal-experience-with-ai">II. Personal Experience with AI:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Experience WODs e.g. E18
I initially employed the AI tool for homework experiential Workouts of the Day (WODs), specifically focusing on exercises E18 to E20, which pertained to the subject of Experience Functional Programming. However, I observed that the tool did not give useful results as it initiated the exercises with concepts that had not been covered in our coursework, diverging significantly from the anticipated solution. Consequently, I proceeded by making my best attempt at the exercises, and in instances where I encountered difficulty, I resorted to watching guided videos to obtain hints and ascertain whether I was on the correct path.</li>
  <li>In-class Practice WODs
Occasionally, when faced with significant challenges and uncertainty during in-class practice Workouts of the Day (WODs), I resorted to utilizing ChatGPT. I would input a general idea to explore the function suggestions provided by ChatGPT. Then, I manually typed out the answer and response to test the code, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of how to implement the function. This approach served as a strategic preparation method for the graded WODs.</li>
  <li>In-class WODs
I have used chatGPT for a few in-class WODs if I was really stuck. Most of the time, I would type all the code, then if I had an error that I didn’t know how to interpret, I would copy my code and the error into ChatGPT to see how chatGPT would fix it. Most of the time, it would provide a valid solution, but sometimes it would spit out an invalid solution. Additionally, it would take some time to trial-and-error to filter through to get a workable solution.</li>
  <li>Essays
I used ChatGPT as a valuable resource for generating ideas and gaining a different perspective while working on essays. Initially, I would outline my thoughts and express my ideas in writing. Subsequently, I utilized ChatGPT to generate bullet points and suggestions on how to expand the essay, allowing me to identify areas for improvement or concepts that I might have overlooked. This collaborative approach with ChatGPT served as a constructive exercise to enhance the depth and clarity of my essays by incorporating diverse perspectives and insights.</li>
  <li>Final project
I utilized ChatGPT as a valuable tool for implementing ideas in my final project. When faced with uncertainties about the implementation of certain features, I would articulate my concept to ChatGPT, seeking guidance on how to realize the intended functionality. While the effectiveness of ChatGPT’s responses varied, often requiring an extended troubleshooting process to seamlessly integrate the suggested code into the original project, it served as a valuable starting point. ChatGPT provided a foundational code snippet that I could adjust and edit to align with my specific requirements for the final project, offering both inspiration and a basis for further refinement.</li>
  <li>Learning a concept / tutorial
I actively used ChatGPT as a valuable resource for learning new concepts, particularly when we delved into the underscore module. To grasp the functionalities of various modules and their practical implementations in code, I would turn to ChatGPT for clear explanations and illustrative examples. Requesting simplified explanations and practical demonstrations from ChatGPT proved to be a more accessible and effective learning method compared to parsing through the extensive documentation of the underscore.js library. This approach not only streamlined the learning process but also provided a more practical and hands-on understanding of the underscore module’s capabilities.</li>
  <li>Answering a question in class or in Discord
I refrained from utilizing ChatGPT to address questions in class or on Discord, particularly when the inquiries pertained to the process of downloading specific tools or components onto my individual system. Recognizing the specificity of these technical concerns, I found it more beneficial to attend the professor’s office hours. During these sessions, I could receive direct, tailored guidance that was better suited to the intricacies of my individual setup, ensuring a more accurate and efficient resolution to my queries. In this context, the professor’s expertise provided a more reliable and targeted solution to system-related questions than the generalized assistance that ChatGPT could offer.</li>
  <li>Asking or answering a smart-question
I would not use chatGPT for asking smart questions, as I found that the responses tended to include extraneous information, resulting in a less concise and focused inquiry.</li>
  <li>Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”
During the initial stages of learning various functions, I relied on ChatGPT as a valuable resource to enhance my understanding. Specifically, for topics like the underscore lecture, I would ask ChatGPT to provide code examples, allowing me to visualize the practical application of the functions in question. This interactive approach with ChatGPT proved effective in supplementing my comprehension by offering real-world examples that reinforced the theoretical concepts covered in the lectures. It became a useful supplementary tool in my learning process, providing practical insights that complemented traditional instructional methods.</li>
  <li>Explaining code
ChatGPT was a valuable tool for explaining code that I found challenging or did not fully understand. By inputting the code snippet into ChatGPT and seeking its interpretation, I could receive alternative explanations and gain insights into the logic and functionality of the code. ChatGPT served as an additional resource, offering diverse perspectives that complemented other learning methods and aided in my comprehensive understanding of complex code structures.</li>
  <li>Writing code
I opted not to rely on ChatGPT for directly generating code based on the instructions, as I believed such an approach would limit my learning experience. Instead, I preferred to initiate the coding process independently by attempting to formulate solutions on my own. Subsequently, I engaged with ChatGPT to troubleshoot any encountered errors, viewing it as a valuable tool for refining and enhancing my understanding of the coding challenges. This method allowed me to leverage ChatGPT selectively, ensuring a more comprehensive and insightful learning process.</li>
  <li>Documenting code
I did not use ChatGPT for documenting code, as I deemed it more time-efficient to manually address the issues by directly modifying or adding comments. The process of typing out the problem and copying and pasting the code for documentation purposes seemed more cumbersome compared to the simplicity of making manual changes. Given the straightforward nature of such tasks, utilizing ChatGPT for documentation appeared to be an unnecessary and time-consuming step.</li>
  <li>Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code <code here="">” or “Fix the ESLint errors in <code here="">”
When I encountered errors and lacked a clear understanding of their nature, I turned to ChatGPT to look up and comprehend the specific error messages. Generally, I took the initiative to address ESLint errors independently, relying on my own problem-solving skills. ChatGPT served as both a resource and a secondary set of eyes for me, particularly when I faced challenges such as forgetting to import a module or identifying a spelling error within my code. This approach allowed me to enhance the accuracy and quality of my code through collaborative problem-solving with ChatGPT.</code></code></li>
  <li>TA practice WODs
I refrained from utilizing ChatGPT for the Teaching Assistant (TA) practice Workouts of the Day (WODs) as I deemed it crucial to independently arrive at solutions. In the context of TA office hours, I prioritized investing the time and effort to comprehend the functionality of the exercises on my own, fostering a self-reliant approach to problem-solving.</li>
</ol>
