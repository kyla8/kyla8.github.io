*JavaScript is the most versatile programming language out there.*

In a world where programming languages jostle for supremacy like gladiators in a digital arena, JavaScript has paved its way and struggled through it all. I’m not here to preach that JavaScript is the one and only programming language out there. But let’s be real -- you got to give it some credit! 

My first experience with JavaScript was in my first programming class in High School. We learned how to make video games, websites, and had a final project where we built a website for an imaginary small business that had frontend and backend features. I won’t lie, I’m not going to miss the endless search for the elusive misplaced semicolons. Also, I liked how everything was open source, so if I had a question about something in JavaScript, no doubt I would be able to find the answer somewhere on StackOverflow. 

After learning various other programming languages -- C, C++, Java, Python, and R -- JavaScript is still the easiest to understand and relearn. It is entirely beginner and expert friendly. On the low end, there are countless things you can do and programs you can make with JavaScript, such as making websites, making a task tracker, utilizing databases, etc. On the high end, there are countless other things you can do, such as Node.js for building servers, user authentication, real-time communication between clients and servers. Whether you’re just starting out in the world of JavaScript or you’re a seasoned developer looking for a challenge, these example projects offer opportunities to learn, practice, and showcase skills. The WODs (timed programming practices) are a bit stressful. For the first couple minutes, I freak out and sometimes overthink what the WOD is asking. 

Now, what you’re really here for -- why “World Domination”? Here, in this era JavaScript reigns supreme. As I look back on my own journey, from battling syntax errors to wielding the mighty arrow functions, I can't help but feel a sense of admiration for this versatile language. It's like a mischievous sidekick that challenges you, frustrates you, but ultimately makes you a better developer.

So, if you are ever worried about AI one day taking over the world, don’t be, because it’ll probably be JavaScript that takes over the world first.
