## Protecting Social Security Beneficiaries: Benefit Reduction to Prevent The Insolvency of the OASDI Trust Funds

*Difficulty: a thing that is hard to accomplish, deal with, or understand.*

As the projection for Social Security Administration (SSA) trust funds continues to decrease and is predicted to exhaust by 2035. Actions must be taken to increase the longevity of the program. If completely exhausted, social security benefits will be cut by 21% for everyone (&ldquo;Social Security: What would happen if the trust funds ran out?&rdquo;). The current process is not sustainable when more benefits are being paid out than can be supported by the income from taxes and bond. This paper shows the unsustainability of social security by analyzing the trust fund balance trend throughout history, the predicted future trust fund balance, and impact of reducing benefits on the risk of trust fund exhaustion and insolvency — specifically evaluating reductions in benefits while shielding the bottom 40% of earners. While reducing benefits does help, it does not allow for a sustainable trust fund. What is the best solution to increasing the longevity of social security trust funds while protecting the lower 40% of earners?

In short, reducing benefits to the upper 60% of earners will not be enough to extend the solvency of the trust fund. Therefore, more changes must be implemented, such as raising taxes or eliminating the wage cap on taxes.

## The History of Social Security

The Social Security program started in 1935; looking to pay benefits to replace a loss of income due to retirement, and later added payments to compensate those with disabilities or death (Daub et al.). From its inception, Congress has tried various mechanisms to ensure the solvency of the trust funds, but they all had some component that was imperfect. (Daub et al.). The latest attempt in 1983, under the SSA, the Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program was created to support a specific demographic. 

## The OASDI Program and Depleting Social Security Trust Funds

The Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program gives monthly benefits to retired or disabled workers, and their dependents. The OASDI is funded by payroll taxes of workers and is held in trust funds invested in U.S. Treasury bonds (&ldquo;Social Security Programs in the United States - Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance&rdquo;). These Social Security trust funds continued to struggle as the average life expectancy grew longer, meaning more benefits were being paid for a longer time. Additionally, birth rates declined, meaning the workforce did not grow as rapidly as it needed to ensure a sufficient income for the SSA trust funds. Eventually, the trust fund will be exhausted and OASDI benefits will be reduced or would be paid on a delayed schedule, harming many Americans by reducing their benefits (&ldquo;Social Security: What would happen if the trust funds ran out?&rdquo;). Many Americans rely on OASDI benefits for most of their income. In 2017, 62 million Americans received about $941 billion in benefits (&ldquo;Annual Statistical Supplement, 2018&rdquo;). Reducing these benefits could potentially put them at risk of poverty and put stress on other federal aid programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) (&ldquo;Characteristics of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Households: Fiscal Year 2018&rdquo;).

Fig. 1. OASDI Income, Cost, and Expenditures as Percentages of Taxable Payroll from the SSA’s 2020 Trustee’s Report. Scheduled benefits are predicted to be reduced to 79% of their scheduled amount in 2035 when the trust fund runs out of money (&ldquo;2020 OASDI Trustees Report&rdquo;).

In Figure 1, provided in the SSA’s 2020 Trustee’s Report depicts the current Trust Fund balance predictions over the years (&ldquo;2020 OASDI Trustees Report&rdquo;). After 2035, one can see that the amount of money required to pay Americans full benefits is much larger than the solid black line, which represents the expenditures that the SSA can fund. 

Today, more Americans are concerned about their social security benefits and retirement plans after the COVID-19 Pandemic. According to two surveys conducted by the Harris Poll for the Nationwide Retirement Institute, 38% of Americans have changed their retirement plans due to COVID-19 (&ldquo;Pandemic has adults across generations more concerned about retirement and Social Security&rdquo;). 19% report they are forced to retire later, and 10% predict they won’t be able to retire at all. 

## Reducing The Benefits And Protecting 40% of Low Earners

A 2017 study conducted by the SSA found that social security income accounted for 90% of 19.6% (or approximately 13.55 million) Americans 65 or older’s total income (Dushi). 

It is predicted that the SSA’s trust funds will become insolvent in 2035 as shown in Figure 2 (&ldquoAnnual Statistical Supplement to the Social Security Bulletin, 2020&rdquo). It was found that reducing benefits by reasonable amounts will not reduce costs by enough to prevent the bankruptcy of the trust fund, and thus, other methods for extending the life of the trust fund should be pursued.

Fig. 2. Graph of Total Trust Fund Balance With No Change. The trendline predicts that in 2035, the trust fund will run out of money, represented with the red line. The yellow dashed line represents the upper bound for the 95% confidence interval and the brown dashed line is the lower bound. The upper bound of the confidence interval also indicates that the trust fund will run out of money in 2035, while the lower bound indicates that the money will run out at the end of 2034 (&ldquo2020 OASDI Trustees Report&rdquo, &ldquoTrust Fund Data&rdquo).

In Figure 2, using historical data of the trust fund balance from 1990 to 2020 from the SSA a trendline was made then extended into the future to predict what the future of the trust fund would look like (&ldquo2020 OASDI Trustees Report&rdquo, &ldquoTrust Fund Data&rdquo). This is also in line with the 2020 Congressional Research Service Report on the SSA’s trust fund, that also predicts that the trust fund will run out of money by 2035 (&ldquoSocial Security: What would happen if the trust funds ran out?&rdquo).

If the trust fund becomes insolvent, Americans in the lowest income will be adversely affected and may seek dependence in other welfare programs. By effectively reducing benefits while shielding 40% of low earners will allow the OASDI program to avoid the risk of exhaustion and continue providing benefits to all Americans after the trust fund is insolvent on the income in different quintiles.
