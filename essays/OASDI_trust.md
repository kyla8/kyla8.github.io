## Protecting Social Security Beneficiaries: Benefit Reduction to Prevent The Insolvency of the OASDI Trust Funds

*Difficulty: a thing that is hard to accomplish, deal with, or understand.*

As the projection for Social Security Administration (SSA) trust funds continues to decrease and is predicted to exhaust by 2035. Actions must be taken to increase the longevity of the program. If completely exhausted, social security benefits will be cut by 21% for everyone (&ldquo;Social Security: What would happen if the trust funds ran out?&rdquo;). The current process is not sustainable when more benefits are being paid out than can be supported by the income from taxes and bond. This paper shows the unsustainability of social security by analyzing the trust fund balance trend throughout history, the predicted future trust fund balance, and impact of reducing benefits on the risk of trust fund exhaustion and insolvency — specifically evaluating reductions in benefits while shielding the bottom 40% of earners. While reducing benefits does help, it does not allow for a sustainable trust fund. What is the best solution to increasing the longevity of social security trust funds while protecting the lower 40% of earners?

In short, reducing benefits to the upper 60% of earners will not be enough to extend the solvency of the trust fund. Therefore, more changes must be implemented, such as raising taxes or eliminating the wage cap on taxes.

## The History of Social Security

The Social Security program started in 1935; looking to pay benefits to replace a loss of income due to retirement, and later added payments to compensate those with disabilities or death (Daub et al.). From its inception, Congress has tried various mechanisms to ensure the solvency of the trust funds, but they all had some component that was imperfect. (Daub et al.). The latest attempt in 1983, under the SSA, the Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program was created to support a specific demographic. 

## The OASDI Program and Depleting Social Security Trust Funds

The Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program gives monthly benefits to retired or disabled workers, and their dependents. The OASDI is funded by payroll taxes of workers and is held in trust funds invested in U.S. Treasury bonds (&ldquo;Social Security Programs in the United States - Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance&rdquo;). These Social Security trust funds continued to struggle as the average life expectancy grew longer, meaning more benefits were being paid for a longer time. Additionally, birth rates declined, meaning the workforce did not grow as rapidly as it needed to ensure a sufficient income for the SSA trust funds. Eventually, the trust fund will be exhausted and OASDI benefits will be reduced or would be paid on a delayed schedule, harming many Americans by reducing their benefits (&ldquo;Social Security: What would happen if the trust funds ran out?&rdquo;). Many Americans rely on OASDI benefits for most of their income. In 2017, 62 million Americans received about $941 billion in benefits (&ldquo;Annual Statistical Supplement, 2018&rdquo;). Reducing these benefits could potentially put them at risk of poverty and put stress on other federal aid programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) (&ldquo;Characteristics of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Households: Fiscal Year 2018&rdquo;).

In Figure 1, provided in the SSA’s 2020 Trustee’s Report depicts the current Trust Fund balance predictions over the years (&ldquo;2020 OASDI Trustees Report&rdquo;). After 2035, one can see that the amount of money required to pay Americans full benefits is much larger than the solid black line, which represents the expenditures that the SSA can fund. 

Today, more Americans are concerned about their social security benefits and retirement plans after the COVID-19 Pandemic. According to two surveys conducted by the Harris Poll for the Nationwide Retirement Institute, 38% of Americans have changed their retirement plans due to COVID-19 (&ldquo;Pandemic has adults across generations more concerned about retirement and Social Security&rdquo;). 19% report they are forced to retire later, and 10% predict they won’t be able to retire at all. 

## Reducing The Benefits And Protecting 40% of Low Earners

A 2017 study conducted by the SSA found that social security income accounted for 90% of 19.6% (or approximately 13.55 million) Americans 65 or older’s total income (Dushi). 

It is predicted that the SSA’s trust funds will become insolvent in 2035 as shown in Figure 2 (&ldquoAnnual Statistical Supplement to the Social Security Bulletin, 2020&rdquo). It was found that reducing benefits by reasonable amounts will not reduce costs by enough to prevent the bankruptcy of the trust fund, and thus, other methods for extending the life of the trust fund should be pursued.

Fig. 2. Graph of Total Trust Fund Balance With No Change. The trendline predicts that in 2035, the trust fund will run out of money, represented with the red line. The yellow dashed line represents the upper bound for the 95% confidence interval and the brown dashed line is the lower bound. The upper bound of the confidence interval also indicates that the trust fund will run out of money in 2035, while the lower bound indicates that the money will run out at the end of 2034 (&ldquo2020 OASDI Trustees Report&rdquo, &ldquoTrust Fund Data&rdquo).

In Figure 2, using historical data of the trust fund balance from 1990 to 2020 from the SSA a trendline was made then extended into the future to predict what the future of the trust fund would look like (&ldquo2020 OASDI Trustees Report&rdquo, &ldquoTrust Fund Data&rdquo). This is also in line with the 2020 Congressional Research Service Report on the SSA’s trust fund, that also predicts that the trust fund will run out of money by 2035 (&ldquoSocial Security: What would happen if the trust funds ran out?&rdquo).

If the trust fund becomes insolvent, Americans in the lowest income will be adversely affected and may seek dependence in other welfare programs. By effectively reducing benefits while shielding 40% of low earners will allow the OASDI program to avoid the risk of exhaustion and continue providing benefits to all Americans after the trust fund is insolvent on the income in different quintiles.

In Figure 3, the trust fund balance was predicted with a 20% reduction of benefits. This resulted in a delay to the insolvency date to 2046. However, that is only a 10 year difference that provides a temporary solution to a semi-permanent problem.

Fig. 4. Trust Fund Balance with 30% Reduction of Benefits for All Quintiles. The limits for the confidence interval value for benefit costs, represented with the red line, was multiplied by 0.7.

In Figure 4, the trust fund balance was predicted with a 30% reduction of benefits. While this did delay the insolvency date to 2055, a 30% reduction would drastically harm beneficiaries in the lower quintiles. While this reduction significantly increased the trust fund balance, the balance began to decrease after 2037. Furthermore, it also did not level out the trust fund balance, meaning that this is just a temporary solution. 

## Risk Analysis

The investigated potential risk mitigation strategy is to shield 40% of people in the OASDI program, and reduce benefits for the upper 60% to save money and ensure trust fund solvency. In reducing benefits for those in the OASDI program is insufficient, as a 20% decrease in all benefits would only extend the solvency of the trust funds to 2046. Even a 30% reduction in all benefits, which would disproportionately hurt people in less economically stable situations, cannot ensure solvency. However, this is a large amount to cut benefits, meaning that other methods of modifying outcomes should be used, such as both raising taxes and reducing benefits by a lower percent. Reducing benefits for the top 60% earners would approximately affect 41.46 million people in the U.S. There is no frequency of risk for this scenario as there is only one event: the bankruptcy of the trust fund that will happen with a 100% chance if no action is taken. 

## Recommendations

To ensure trust fund solvency in the future, actions in addition to reducing benefits must be taken. Another solution to further research would be to increase the payroll taxes for the upper 60% (based on individual income) which will result in increasing the amount of money dedicated to the SSA’s trust funds, extending its life. Previous steps toward this solution have been taken, however no real progress has been proven. By taking this course of action, it will not provide a complete solution, but it could be a step to reduce taking dramatic actions. 

Determining a solution to create a more sustainable trust fund has been ignored for too long. If the government had taken initiative 10 years ago, by reducing benefits for the highest quintile by 20% and by 10% for the 2nd and 3rd highest quintiles, the trust fund would be much more sustainable, and the reduction of benefits or increase in taxes would be of a lesser magnitude (Figure 5). While these changes in 2010 would not have set the trust fund up for solvency, it would have given the government more time and resources to take other action. However, this action was not taken then and we must act now, or the trust fund will be exhausted in around 15 years. If benefits are reduced for those who really need them and more Americans fall into poverty, many will lose trust in the government and there could be potential uprisings. While the solution does reduce benefits, it ensures that those in the lower percentile income keep their benefits to ensure that they are supported.

## To Current

The Social security trust funds are projected to become insolvent by 2035. Social security funds are supported by 6.2% of the 7.65% payroll tax that workers and employers are expected to pay. People who are self employed pay the employee and employer portions resulting in 12.4% of their wages (Franklin). The maximum taxable earning base, or the point at which the amount of a wage is taxed by the payroll tax is capped, is based upon the average wages of Americans and has thus increased overtime due to inflation and economic growth. Under the taxable maximum in 2020 at $137,700, the maximum dollar amount that can be taken out of a wage or salary of an employee is $8,537 (“Social Security & Medicare Tax Rates”). The percentage of workers with wages above the maximum taxable earning base is generally between 6% and 7% since 2000 (“Social Security: Raising or Eliminating the Taxable Earnings Base” - Table A1). In the last few decades the rising wage disparity between the upper and middle/lower class has resulted in wage coverage under the maximum taxable earning base decreasing from 90% (1982) to 83% (2018) (“Social Security: Raising or Eliminating the Taxable Earnings Base” - Table A1).
Based on the findings of this report, solely reducing benefits has been proved to no longer be a viable solution for preserving Social Security trust funds for an extended period of time. A solution proposed by the Social Security Advisory Board for preserving the Social Security trust funds include modifying laws surrounding the specifics of payroll tax by increasing the payroll tax rate with no changes to the taxable maximum.
Increase Payroll Tax [Regressive Tax]
Based on the solutions proposed by the Social Security Advisory Board in the summarized report from data in the 2020 Trustee Report, the varied proposed policies for increasing the payroll tax have the potential to eliminate between 17% to 120% of the 75 year shortfall for the social security program (“Provisions Affecting Payroll Taxes”). However, increasing the payroll tax without also increasing the taxable earning base will significantly impact the lower- and middle-class more than the upper class. The unchanged Social Security base encourages a regressive tax structure where the 6% of workers with salaries above the current maximum would be paying a significantly smaller portion of their earnings to payroll tax in comparison to everyone below the wage cap:
In 2020, someone with annual earnings of $50,000 pays $3,100 in Social Security taxes, or 6.2% of his or her earnings (ignoring the employer share of the tax). However, because the tax is levied on only the first $137,700 in earnings, someone earning $200,000 a year pays $8,537, or 4.2% of his or her earnings. (“Social Security: Raising or Eliminating the Taxable Earnings Base”).
The most effective policies for increasing the payroll tax are E1.1 – which will “Increase the payroll tax rate (currently 12.4 percent) to 15.9 percent in 2033-2062, and to 19.4 percent in years 2063 and later,” and E1.2 – “Increase the payroll tax rate (currently 12.4 percent) to 15.8 percent in 2021 and later” (“Provisions Affecting Payroll Taxes”). E1.1 and E1.2 are projected to eliminate 120% and 101% of the social security trust fund shortfall in the next 75 years respectively. Amongst all policies proposed from all the three provision types, E1.1 and E1.2 are the only policies that eliminate the entirety of the projected shortfall in the next 75 years. The downside of policy E1.1 is that it will only come into effect beginning in 2033, which is 2 years prior to the projected insolvency of current Social Security trust funds and thus may not produce enough of a change to avoid significant benefit cuts. As for E1.2, the immediate increase of payroll tax by 3.4% (which is 0.2% above the current law shortfall for long term actuarial balance) will dramatically impact the take-home pay of the lower- and middle-class, especially given the rise of unemployment as a result of the COVID pandemic.
Alternative: Retirement Without Depending on the Government
In preparation for a reduction of benefits in the case of insolvency of the SSA’s trust funds, more Americans can search for pension plans or other means of supporting themselves during retirement. A pension plan requires employers to create a fixed benefit plan for workers’ retirement, with a guaranteed monthly benefit (Tretina). This would allow workers to accurately predict their retirement income and budget based on this. Taxes also must be paid based on pension payouts.
On the other hand, a 401(k) plan bases retirement income on one’s personal savings based on a portion of one’s salary, and the employer matches contribution, noting contribution limits (Tretina). However, employers do not always match contribution levels. By choosing investments, 401(k)s do not have a set monthly payment of benefits, and can change based on the overall economy therefore being difficult to predict. With a 401(k), one can opt to get a tax break as salary is put aside, and then pay taxes on what is withdrawn during retirement, or one can pay taxes, and then get a tax break during retirement.
Americans will continue receiving OASDI benefits, even if they receive benefits from private sources, therefore allowing retirees to collect more money. However, these solutions are taxing on the employers, costing them time and effort to determine a plan for their employees’ retirement. 
With this in mind, Americans should also take initiative themselves to ensure they can support themselves in retirement. Americans should research investing in stocks, hedge funds, or bonds, which will allow one to gain money over time (“Ultimate guide to retirement”). One must be weary when investing, due to the fluctuations of the market. There are also retirement plans, such as the Individual Retirement Account, which allows an individual to set aside money for retirement based on earned income (Coombes).
Conclusion
It is too late to use reducing benefits as a safe means to stabilize the OASDI trust fund and prevent insolvency. Reducing the benefits enough to significantly delay the bankruptcy would hurt the beneficiaries earlier than necessary while not actually solving the problem. To address projected risk, both economic and social, the insolvency of the trust fund might put the lower quintiles at greater risk for food insecurity and homelessness, so legal action should be taken to prevent insolvency. Based on the research, a policy that increases or eliminates the cap on maximum taxable earnings and does not reduce benefits. Essentially, this policy would have a high return value on the amount of money generated, due to the fact that it would make it so the upper 6% of earners are paying a more equal percentage of their income in taxes, in comparison to those earning under the current maximum taxable earnings cap. Based on the current proposals indicates that this would be the most effective policy for preventing trust fund insolvency that also poses little to no risk to the lower and middle class.
