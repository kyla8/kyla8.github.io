## Protecting Social Security Beneficiaries: Benefit Reduction to Prevent The Insolvency of the OASDI Trust Funds

*Difficulty: a thing that is hard to accomplish, deal with, or understand.*

As the projection for Social Security Administration (SSA) trust funds continues to decrease and is predicted to exhaust by 2035. Actions must be taken to increase the longevity of the program. If completely exhausted, social security benefits will be cut by 21% for everyone (&ldquo;Social Security: What would happen if the trust funds ran out?&rdquo;). The current process is not sustainable when more benefits are being paid out than can be supported by the income from taxes and bond. This paper shows the unsustainability of social security by analyzing the trust fund balance trend throughout history, the predicted future trust fund balance, and impact of reducing benefits on the risk of trust fund exhaustion and insolvency â€” specifically evaluating reductions in benefits while shielding the bottom 40% of earners. While reducing benefits does help, it does not allow for a sustainable trust fund. What is the best solution to increasing the longevity of social security trust funds while protecting the lower 40% of earners?

In short, reducing benefits to the upper 60% of earners will not be enough to extend the solvency of the trust fund. Therefore, more changes must be implemented, such as raising taxes or eliminating the wage cap on taxes.

## The History of Social Security

The Social Security program started in 1935; looking to pay benefits to replace a loss of income due to retirement, and later added payments to compensate those with disabilities or death (Daub et al.). From its inception, Congress has tried various mechanisms to ensure the solvency of the trust funds, but they all had some component that was imperfect. (Daub et al.). The latest attempt in 1983, under the SSA, the Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program was created to support a specific demographic. 

## The OASDI Program and Depleting Social Security Trust Funds

The Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program gives monthly benefits to retired or disabled workers, and their dependents. The OASDI is funded by payroll taxes of workers and is held in trust funds invested in U.S. Treasury bonds (&ldquo;Social Security Programs in the United States - Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance&rdquo;). These Social Security trust funds continued to struggle as the average life expectancy grew longer, meaning more benefits were being paid for a longer time. Additionally, birth rates declined, meaning the workforce did not grow as rapidly as it needed to ensure a sufficient income for the SSA trust funds. Eventually, the trust fund will be exhausted and OASDI benefits will be reduced or would be paid on a delayed schedule, harming many Americans by reducing their benefits (&ldquo;Social Security: What would happen if the trust funds ran out?&rdquo;). Many Americans rely on OASDI benefits for most of their income. In 2017, 62 million Americans received about $941 billion in benefits (&ldquo;Annual Statistical Supplement, 2018&rdquo;). Reducing these benefits could potentially put them at risk of poverty and put stress on other federal aid programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) (&ldquo;Characteristics of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Households: Fiscal Year 2018&rdquo;).
