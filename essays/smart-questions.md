## Is there such thing as a stupid question?

In the evolving digital world of software engineering, there will always be questions – good or bad? That’s still up in the air. 

Smart questions are well written, intelligent, and well-reasoned inquiries that spark conversations that have effective problem-solving. Smart questions serve as a catalyst for deeper conversations and understanding in software development. Smart questions are important in order to have effective problem solving in order to pinpoint the main issue at hand. It is also important to have clear communication to properly transfer knowledge and avoid misunderstandings. Asking the right questions can help with sparking innovation and creativity that can lead to continuous improvement. 

Having a smart question also helps to alleviate stress from the moderators. Some pet peeves of StackOverflow moderators are those questions without any code snippets and doesn’t include the language or platform the inquirer uses. It is also maddening for moderators to see the inquirer that doesn’t help themselves and just says “my code doesn’t work. Fix it”.

Characteristics of smart questions include something that is specific to what the software issue is, includes code snippets of what the user has previously tried, describing what language and software platform they are using. These details can help other users properly identify the issue and help solve the problem. 

This [StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77056774/how-can-i-convert-the-time-stamp-with-timezone-info-to-utc-time-in-python) asks for help converting the timestamp data with timezones to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) time in python. The inquirer gave the specifics (but short and sweet – straight to the point) on their problem for what language they were operating in, as well as the exact timestamp they were trying to convert. The inquirer also provided a code snippet for the line of code they wrote. 

Here is another example of a [StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14146247/is-there-a-way-of-placing-a-video-in-my-java-game-main-menu) that asks how to place a video in the main menu of a video game in Java. This inquirer also listed the specifics of what the exact problem was and that the language they are programming in is Java. They also include code snippets of all the code needed for the viewers to understand the issue. The responses to this questions match the same level of “smartness” the question has.
