<p>Through my involvement with Kalani High School’s FIRST robotics team (Team Magma 3008), I was presented with a unique opportunity to spearhead an all-girls academy. From being a middle-school student being taught these skills to being a part of the volunteering and teaching litle kids robotics in other academies I’ve been a part of (freshman year of High School). Then, I became the project manger who runs the event. It was transformative to see the my own growth and change. After having run the event, I had the idea for a new program that focused more on the cybersecurity aspect – Seeing that it is a rising field in the world.</p>

<p>Girls learn about S.T.E.M. in a creative and fun environment that provides activities such as Kahoot, capture the flag, bit bingo, etc. Cybersecurity is a computer science field that I don’t see many girls being involved in. This year, I proposed a new class, different from the year-to-year Lego NXT and Coding with KANO that we normally do. I wanted to educate girls specifically on cybersecurity issues, in terms of cryptography, python programming, binary, web analysis and steganography.

<p>Girls in Technology, Engineering, and Computing (GTEC) is a student-led academy hosted by the girls of Team Magma. They follow their motto of “For girls, by girls”. The target audience for enrollment in these academies are 1st to 8th grade girls. As stated in the mission and vision, the goal is to produce and prepare leaders for the real world while simultaneously spreading the ideas of science, technology, education, art, and mathematics (STEAM). This creates a strong foundation for the future of STEAM based professions. Specifically for GTEC, the long term goal is to educate young girls so they may one day help bridge the gender gap in STEAM related fields.</p>

<p>In this academy, Team Magma has a few of their female members of their team host a week-long program running about 4 hours per day. Student mentors and female guests use LEGO EV3 parts to help young women explore robotics and become involved and inspired in STEAM. This program usually involves around 10 to 14 girls.</p>

<p>Additionally, Team Magma uses this opportunity as a way to fundraise the team while also demonstrating connection to their community and spreading their mission goals. Because of Covid restrictions in the past year, Team Magma has had to cancel this program. The last time this program was hosted was in 2019. However, this coming summer, Team Magma aims to bring back this program with the necessary Covid precautions. The plan is to create a program that gives as much opportunity to young girls as possible by creating an environment where girls are allowed to explore their interests and learn valuable skill sets.</p>
